# Tiny Wasteland GM Toolkit
Tools repository for the Tiny Wasteland system

This repository holds tools to help Game Masters develop worlds for the Tiny Wasteland TinyD6 game system. These tools could be used for other game systems, but are specifically tuned to Tiny Wasteland.

# Tools

This repository contains tools for the following:

 1. Character Generator /cmd/character-generator
    This can be used to generate player characters, non-player characters, and enemies. It's intended to provide starting information to help develop characters.
 1. Vehicle Generator /cmd/vehicle-generator
    This can be used to generate player vehicles, enclave fleets, and enemy vehicles. It's intended to provide starting information to help develop vehicles.
 1. Enemy Generator /cmd/enemy-generator
    This can be used to generate enemies. It's intended to provide starting information to help develop or fill out encounters. Traits are determined based on threat level and companions may be generated if the threat level is high enough. Generic animals may also be generated.
 1. Roll /cmd/roll
    Accepts the common dice roll terminology (2d6 for 2 6-sided dice) and displays the total of the entire roll and each die value rolled.
